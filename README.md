Hipster Multi-Theme React App
A modern, fully responsive React + TypeScript demo with theme switching (3 variants), persistent theme, adaptive sidebar, card product grid (via API), and mobile-first layouts.

✨ Features
3 scalable visual themes (light, dark/sidebar, colorful grid)

Layout adapts per theme (minimalist, sidebar, playful grid)

Sidebar fits desktop and mobile automatically

Cards/data loaded from FakeStoreAPI

Theme, fonts, and structure responsive for all screens

Background/font transitions on theme change

No big UI library – just React, React Router, TypeScript, Vite

🏁 Quick Start
1️⃣ Clone & Install
text
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
(If you need to create this from scratch, use npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts, then copy in the code.)

2️⃣ Run Development
text
npm run dev
This uses Vite and will show a local dev server (usually at http://localhost:5173).

3️⃣ Try It Out!
Use the theme dropdown in the top-right to switch between the three themes.

All layouts instantly update. Try on phones/tablets for the responsive sidebar and card grid!
